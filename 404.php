	<h1>Oh snap!</h1>

	<p>The page you're looking for was looted by pirates! (<em>Or more likely, I messed up and moved something on you - sorry!</em>) At this point, you have a few options:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Use the search box thingy in the sidebar.</li>
		<li>Become a pirate hunter and embark on a quest to reclaim the lost page.</li>
		<li>Give up and go make something awesome instead.</li>
	</ol>
