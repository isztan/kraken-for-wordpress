# Kraken for WordPress
An add-on to the [Kraken boilerplate](http://cferdinandi.github.com/kraken/) for WordPress developers.

Kraken for WordPress includes:

* The essential templates you need to start building a WordPress site.
* Useful functions to help improve site performance and make development easier.
* A WordPress theme stylesheet with a few WordPress-specific classes that control image and avatar styling.

## Built for Kraken
Kraken for WordPress was built as an add-on for the [Kraken boilerplate](http://cferdinandi.github.com/kraken/).

Aside from the theme header and a few WordPress-specific classes, the stylesheet is empty. Drop in the Kraken boilerplate, or write your own stylesheet from scratch.

## Documentation
Because most of the code in Kraken for WordPress uses standard WordPress functions, it doesn't include a lot of inline documentation. Please consult the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page) for more information on specific functions.
